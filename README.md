# RPA Challenge RoboCorp

### Notes:
- Since the Scope of the application isn't that big, i've separated into just a couple files, following a common structure that i use.
- APNews don't filter a exact number of new posts, just sorts by newest, so i defined a limit for how many you want to get.
- Also APNews don't seems to have a filter based on a category and a search, it just shows some related news to the category, if you search something it don't relates to the previows filter.
- I've used a misture of the RPA Framework and pure selenium to this solution, as required on the challenge, and didn't used any HTTP request, ~~even if it was easier~~.
